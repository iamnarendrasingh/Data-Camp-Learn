#Variable assignment
# Assign the value 42 to x
x <- 42
# Print out the value of the variable x
x
##Variable assignment (2)
# Assign the value 5 to the variable my_apples
my_apples <- 5
# Print out the value of the variable my_apples
my_apples
###Variable assignment (3)
# Assign a value to the variables my_apples and my_oranges
my_apples <- 5
my_oranges <- 6
# Add these two variables together
print(my_apples + my_oranges)
# Create the variable my_fruit
my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges
####Apples and oranges
# Assign a value to the variable my_apples
my_apples <- 5
# Fix the assignment of my_oranges
my_oranges <- 6
# Create the variable my_fruit and print it out
my_fruit <- my_apples + my_oranges

# Basic data types in R
# R works with numerous data types. Some of the most basic types to get started are:
#Decimal values like 4.5 are called numerics.
#Whole numbers like 4 are called integers. Integers are also numerics.
#Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE) are called logical.
#Text (or string) values are called characters.
#Note how the quotation marks in the editor indicate that "some text" is a string.
# Change my_numeric to be 42
my_numeric <- 42
# Change my_character to be "universe"
my_character <- "universe"
# Change my_logical to be FALSE
my_logical <- FALSE
######### What's that data type?
# Do you remember that when you added 5 + "six",
# you got an error due to a mismatch in data types? You can avoid such embarrassing situations
#by checking the data type of a variable beforehand. You can do this with
# the class() function, as the code in the editor shows.
# Declare variables of different types
my_numeric <- 42
my_character <- "universe"
my_logical <- FALSE
# Check class of my_numeric
class(my_numeric)
# Check class of my_character
class(my_character)
# Check class of my_logical
class(my_logical)
