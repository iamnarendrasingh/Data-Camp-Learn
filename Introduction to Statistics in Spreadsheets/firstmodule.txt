Average / Mean 	=>	Sum of observation/ Toal Number of observation
Median 			=>	Sort smallest to highest ,  middle number is median
Mode 			=>	Maximum occurace of a number in a string.

Median can be use to remove outliers. 

How to calculate Mean,median,mode in Excel
	Mean == [=average()]
	Meadian == [=median()]
	Mode == [=mode()]

How to calculate variance
	calculte mean  then subtract mean from number.
	Square difference and than take average

In excel formula =varp()

SD(Standard Deviation)

sqrt of variance [=sqrt()]
or use stdevp()

Percentile 
=quartile(N,1)
=quartile(N,2)
=quartile(N,3)
=quartile(N,4)

A useful statistic computed from the quartiles is the "interquartile range" (IQR), which lies between the Q1 and Q3 and represents the middle 50% of the data.

=====================
Standardized Data

Standard score(z-score)
	calculate mean , then standard deviation
	==[=standardize()]
