Visualizing correlations

Scatterplots
	visulaize single varibale 
	each dot represent a row in data 
	trend line can help you to make imaginztion real.
	=linest(rangeX,rangeY)

	1) 0 correlation means there is no relationship between variables.
	2) Positive correlation indicate that as one variable increases, the other also increases.
	3) Negative correlation values signify that as one variable increases, the other decreases.

Adding a trend line
	Spreadsheets have 3 formulas for calculating the y-intercept and slope given two variables.

	1) SLOPE() - will return the slope of a trend line or linear regression representing the linear change in one unit to another.
	2) INTERCEPT() - returns the value where the trendline will intersect the y-axis.
	3) LINEST() - calculates both the slope & the intercept of two variables using the least-squares method.

Bar Charts
	Your job in this exercise is to create two types of bar charts: stacked, and side-by-side. The difference is subtle but helps your audience in different ways.

		1) Stacked: helps you focus on the proportion of the total that is a particular class. You will visually understand the amount of the total that represents competitive online auctions.

		2) Side-by-side: lets the audience understand the values in relation to each other. You will visually interpret how similar each class values are.
