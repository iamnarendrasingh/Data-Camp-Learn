Visualizing correlations

	1) 0 correlation means there is no relationship between variables.
	2) Positive correlation indicate that as one variable increases, the other also increases.
	3) Negative correlation values signify that as one variable increases, the other decreases.

Adding a trend line
	Spreadsheets have 3 formulas for calculating the y-intercept and slope given two variables.

	1) SLOPE() - will return the slope of a trend line or linear regression representing the linear change in one unit to another.
	2) INTERCEPT() - returns the value where the trendline will intersect the y-axis.
	3) LINEST() - calculates both the slope & the intercept of two variables using the least-squares method.
