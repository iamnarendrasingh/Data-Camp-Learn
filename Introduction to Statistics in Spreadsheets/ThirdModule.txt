Central to Stats: Sampling

Sampling vs populations

Sampling
	subset of populations
	as sample increase , close statistics 

Central limit theorem(CLT)

=================
Hypothesis Testing
	Any testable claim

Null vs Alternate 

Null
	Accepted fact
	H0
	Average ferrari price is equal to average car price
		FAIL TO Reject

Alternate
	Challenger Statement
	H1
	Average ferrari price is not equal to average car price

REJECT Null Hypothesis 
FAIL tO REJECT 

t-test
	t.test(range1,range2,tails,type)
	produce p value 1%(.01) 5%(.05)
	n<30
==========
z-test
	p < 0.05	REJECT
	p > .05		FAIL TO REJECT
	n>30
	z.test(range1 , testStatistic ,STDEC)

================
Ch squared test
	Data has to be in groups 
	[=chitest(observed_range , expected_range)]
