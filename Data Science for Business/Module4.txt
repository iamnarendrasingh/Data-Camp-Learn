Supervised Machine Learning

ML is for making prediction 
SML is subset of ML method where existing data has specific struture 

Data has features and labels
	Features :	Data that help us to predict the label
	Label 	 :	What we want to predict

SML can solve below problem 
	1.Recommendation System
	2.Email subject optimization
	3.Churn Prediction


Churn Prediction
	first we need training data (historical data/past data)
	than we need features like age , gender ,salary , number of kids etc.
	Than we can make trained model 

Model Evaluation is must.


==================================
Model Evaluation
Decision Tree 
Logistic 
Random Forest


===========================
Clustering 

	Set of algo that devide data into category 

Clustering is pasrt of Unsupervised ML 
ML use features and label however UML used features only.

==============
Special Topics in ML

Time Series Forcasting 
	1.Time is feature
	2.Seasonality
	accounts for weekly , monthly 
	catch period events 
	catch seasonality
		Weekly :	weekend TV time less
		Monthly:	less spend in month end
		Yearly:		Ice cream sales down in winters


Natural Languahe Processing
	1.Text as input data
	2. Word count
	3. Word embedding
Dataset is text
	tweets 
	reviews 
	email subjects

Word embeddings : Group together similar words
					Features have a matheatical meaning

Sentiment Analysis

========================
DL and Explainable AI

DL
	AKA : Neural Nets/ Neural Networks 
	Require more and more data
	less structure data
	great for predictive model 

When to use DL
